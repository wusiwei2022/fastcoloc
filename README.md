# fastcoloc
Pacakge fastcoloc is built to streamline the colocoalization and multi-trait colocalization analysis.<br>  

## Background
Colocalization is one of the most important methods for analyzing GWAS summary data. The analysis can be run with coloc and moloc R package.
However, both coloc and moloc package requires researchers to pre-format their GWAS summary data set.
We build up this tool to faciliate the preprocessing and preformatting of the GWAS summary data for coloc/moloc analysis.

## Usage
```{r}
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("wusiwei2022/fastcoloc")
```

## To do
Function statement, example data, and example codes will be made available soon.
Regional genomic plots tailed for colocalization analysis will be available in the future updata.<br>
